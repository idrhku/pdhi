			<p>The institute program is built around a wide-ranging but complementary mix of topics and includes 3 broad types of sessions—(a) interactive learning and discussion; (b) case studies;  and (c) technical training—summarized below.</p>

<h2 id="interactive-learning-and-discussion-sessions">Interactive Learning and Discussion Sessions</h2>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Humanities for All</em> – this opening session will explore principles of public humanities and lay the groundwork for the work of the institute.</li>
  <li><em>Academia vs the Non-Profit Sector</em> – this panel, featuring representatives from non-profits in the Lawrence/Kansas City region, explores differences between the structures, work cultures, and  operational philosophies of these two sectors.</li>
  <li><em>Developing Strong Community Partnerships</em> – participants will engage in hands-on exercises to  develop plans for fostering strong community partnerships.</li>
  <li><em>Participatory Design with Community Partners</em> – participants will learn techniques for collaborative design and planning.</li>
  <li><em>The Socio-Technical Sustainability Roadmap</em> – participants will learn how to develop sustainability plans that address their project’s social as well as technical needs and infrastructure.</li>
  <li><em>Cultural Heritage and Protocols for Indigenous Access</em> – this session looks at Indigenous information management systems and cultural protocols and explores how these principles can inform any  community-based digital project.</li>
  <li><em>Oral History 101</em> – participants will learn about the core components of an oral history project,  including ethical and legal considerations, project planning, and the interview process.</li>
  <li><em>Project Funding</em> – participants will develop a deeper understanding of what their project costs are and how to go about seeking funding to cover those costs.</li>
  <li><em>Project Marketing</em> – participants will learn strategies to market their projects to ensure it reaches their intended audiences.</li>
  <li><em>Telling Stories with Maps and Data Visualizations</em> – participants will explore projects that use maps and visualizations to make impactful social change.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="case-studies">Case Studies</h2>
<p><br />
Both the digital humanities and the public humanities make extensive use of case  studies to share knowledge and provide models for work, and the institute will embrace this approach.</p>

<p>Each day of the institute will open with a case study presented by that project’s director. These case  studies highlight a range of platforms and modes of digital scholarship (e.g., archiving, mapping, oral  histories, storytelling) and will provide participants with real-world examples to draw from.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>The Lakeland Community Heritage Project</em>, a multi-year community-university collaboration to  document, in the voices of community members, the history of Lakeland, a historical African  American community established in 1890 in College Park, MD.</li>
  <li><em>The American Indian Digital History Project</em>, a cooperative founded to recover and preserve rare  Indigenous newspapers, photographs, and archival materials from across Native North America.</li>
  <li><em>Under the Rainbow: Oral Histories of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer People in  Kansas</em>, a series of interviews that documents the life stories and experiences of GLBTQ Kansans. It  is the first online open access oral history collection of GLBTQ Kansans in the US.</li>
  <li><em>Ellas Tienen Nombre (“They Have Names”)</em>, an independent-scholar led project to gather public data  and document murdered women and girls in Ciudad Juárez through mapping and visualization.</li>
  <li><em>The Emmett Till Memory Project</em>, a collaborative production of the Emmett Till Memorial  Commission of Tallahatchie County, Mississippi, and scholars across the country, that has been  named by the National Humanities Alliance as a top 5% public project in the country.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="technical-training">Technical Training</h2>
<p><br />
The emphasis of the technical track is on developing an awareness and understanding  of foundational concepts and common tools and methods, rather than proficiency in a specific tool or  method. These introductory sessions will give participants knowledge of the options available to them  and resources available to pursue these topics further. Some sessions will be offered concurrently, with  participants able to choose one of two sessions. This allows for smaller, more-effective hands-on sessions,  while still allowing team members to split up and attend all workshops offered.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Digital content platforms and web hosting:</em> participants will learn about a range of digital project  platforms, along with web-hosting options and what to look for in a web-hosting provider.</li>
  <li><em>Omeka:</em> participants will get hands-on experience using this popular open-source publishing platform  suitable for a wide range of digital humanities projects.</li>
  <li><em>Mukurtu:</em> participants will get hands-on experience with this platform built in dialogue with  Indigenous communities, allowing communities to share materials in culturally appropriate ways.</li>
  <li><em>Accessible and inclusive web design:</em> participants will learn about principles of accessible design, multi-lingual websites, and developing mobile applications</li>
  <li><em>Metadata and data management for DH projects:</em> participants will learn what metadata is, why it is  important, and how to effectively create and manage metadata, along with effective practices for data  management and project documentation.</li>
  <li><em>Mapping and data visualizations:</em> participants will create sample data sets and learn how to  incorporate them into mapping and visualization platforms.</li>
  <li><em>Digital audio and video:</em> participants will learn about hardware and software options and good  practices for producing audio and video content for oral histories or podcasting.</li>
  <li><em>Access, ownership, and reuse:</em> participants will learn basic literacy that addresses both the rights of  creators as well as users.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to these sessions, we have also incorporated time each day for participants to network,  explore and share with each other. We believe this will be one of the most valuable aspects of the  institute. <em>Participant Project Sharing</em> sessions will let participants engage in conversation about their  projects around a specific focus question for each session. 90-minute catered lunch periods will offer a  chance for participants to dine in small groups with each other and with the institute faculty present that  day (and an opportunity to take a break and explore the beautiful KU campus). Each day will conclude with a <em>feedback and reflection period</em>, where participants will share key takeaways from the day, do  several minutes of silent writing for their own use to help them capture and synthesize ideas before the  day ends, and submit a short, anonymous feedback slip about the day’s sessions. The afternoon of the  final day will feature teams presenting <em>lightning talks</em> about their key takeaways from the institute and  next steps.</p>

<h2 id="online-program">Online Program</h2>
<p><br />
After the completion of the in-person program, the institute will continue virtually  for one year. This is the time for the participants to return home and put the lessons learned during the in person week into practice to advance their projects. Institute staff will provide structure and content in the  form of workshops, consultations, and email discussions.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Six 90-minute <strong>webinar-style workshops</strong> will include technical trainings and discussions that expand  upon the topics covered during the in-person program, or delve into new areas. Specific topics will be  determined in collaboration with the participants, based on their needs at the end of the in-person  program. (See Attachment 3 for a menu of topics). These workshops will be led by institute staff or  faculty who have agreed to participate in the year-long program.</li>
  <li>Institute staff or faculty will conduct hour-long <strong>consultations</strong> with each project team, four times  during the course of the year.</li>
  <li>Institute staff will maintain an <strong>email discussion list</strong> where participants can ask questions, share  developments, and alert each other to external opportunities. Institute staff will take an active role in  seeding the listserv with discussion topics and announcements to maintain an active community.</li>
  <li>At the end of the year, in June 2023, we will host a <strong>virtual symposium</strong> featuring final presentations  from project teams, reporting on progress made during the year and sharing reflections. The  presentations will be recorded and posted on the institute website for public viewing.</li>
</ul>
