### 8:00-8:30AM: Sign-in (Coffee and Light Snacks)
### 8:30-9:30AM: CASE STUDY: The Lakeland Community Heritage Project
#### Facilitators: Stephanie Sapienza, Violetta Sharps Jones
* The Lakeland Community Heritage Project (LCHP) Digital Archive is a community-university
collaboration to document, in the voices of community members, the history of Lakeland, an
historical African American community established in 1890 and located in College Park, MD. The
Archive contains photographs, land records, census data, newspaper clippings, maps, dozens of
oral history sound files, archival records, and video recordings, documenting the community
before and after segregation and contributing to an understanding of urban renewal's impact on
communities of color. The partnership provides LCHP -- an all-volunteer historical society -- with
student and faculty labor to help document and archive Lakeland's history, while training
students in an ethical and equitable practice of collaborative heritage research. Originally
established in 2009, the partnership is entering a new stage which will see the redesign of the
archive using minimal computing approaches and the creation of tutorials to teach other
community organizations how to build and maintain digital public humanities projects that are
resilient, shareable online and off, and amenable to models of shared governance.
### 9:30-10:30AM: Building Trust: Participatory Design with Community Partners, Part I
#### Facilitators: Shannon Criss, Nils Gore, Matt Kleinman
* This interactive session will follow the work of the Dotte Agency, a multi-disciplinary design
collaborative engaging neighborhoods to shape the built environment in order to improve public
health. The presenters will demonstrate how early-action projects with community partners in
Wyandotte County, Kansas led to storytelling projects, which in turn led to future community-led
design efforts that are ongoing. The session will introduce the Principles of Community
Engagement from the Clinical & Translational Science Awards (CTSA) that Dotte Agency has
adapted into their multi-disciplinary collaborative approach. Community partners will be invited
to share their perspectives and experiences through pre-recorded conversations that introduce
each example project during the session. Participants will be guided to map out potential projects
in their own environment where storytelling and building trust can lead to design and further
action with community partners. Project resources and videos are available on the Dotte Agency
website: http://www.dotteagency.org.
* Focus Question: How do you ensure community stakeholders are fully engaged?
### 10:30-10:45AM: BREAK
### 10:45-12 NOON: Building Trust: Participatory Design with Community Partners, Part II
* The session above continues after a short break
### 12:00-1:30PM: LUNCH
* Catered lunch at the Hall Center. Participants dine in small groups with institute staff and guest
faculty for the day.
### 1:30-3:00PM: The Socio-Technical Sustainability Roadmap, Section A
#### Facilitators: Aisling Quigley, Chelsea Gunn
* The Socio-Technical Sustainability Roadmap (STSR) is a structured workshop that guides project
teams through the practice of creating effective sustainability plans. It is based on research
findings that demonstrate that the needs of a project’s social infrastructure must be addressed
alongside the needs of its technological infrastructure in order to successfully sustain digital
work over time. During this institute the facilitators, members of the team that developed the
Roadmap, will guide participants through “Section A: Project Survey” and “Section B: Staffing
and Technologies” of the STSR. These generative, collaborative sections walk participants
through the process of evaluating their project’s scope, audience, and sustainability priorities as
well as the socio-technical infrastructure needed to maintain the project. After the institute has
ended and participants have had the opportunity to share their work from Sections A and B and
identify their sustainability priorities with their complete project teams, the facilitators will
provide virtual follow-up sessions to support participants through the completion of “Section C:
Digital Sustainability Plans.” All workshop materials are available on the STSR project website,
http://sustainingdh.net.
* Focus Questions: What are your project’s scope, audience, and sustainability priorities?
### 3:00-3:15PM: BREAK
### 3:15-5:00PM: The Socio-Technical Sustainability Roadmap, Section B
* The session above continues after a short break
* Focus Question: What social and technical infrastructures do you need to maintain your
project
### 5:00-5:30PM: Daily Feedback and Reflection
#### Facilitators: Brian Rosenblum & Dave Tell
* Participants share their key takeaways from today’s sessions, do a 5-minute free writing
reflection for their own use, and complete a daily feedback slip.
## Day 3: Wednesday, June 8th, 2022
### 8:00-8:30AM: Sign-in (Coffee and Light Snacks)
### 8:30-9:30AM: CASE STUDY: The American Indian Digital History Project
#### Facilitator: Kent Blansett
* This innovative digital project is a cooperative partnership between the University of Kansas, the
University of Nebraska at Omaha (UNO), Tribal communities, Tribal Colleges, Native
organizations, Libraries, Universities/Colleges, and the larger public. AIDHP works in partnership
with these communities to promote the recovery, sharing, preservation, and protection of rare
Tribal archival and primary source materials. The cooperative digitizes key primary source
documents and makes them free, searchable, and accessible to the greater public. AIDHP
encourages responsible American Indian research methods and the increased use of Native
source materials. The project started forging partnerships with Native Nations and Indigenous
communities located throughout the surrounding region of Nebraska with the intent of
expanding the project nationally.
### 9:30-10:30AM: Cultural Heritage and Protocols for Indigenous Access
#### Facilitators: Kim Christen, Michael Wynne
* This session explores the need to infuse Indigenous information management systems,
curatorial processes, and cultural protocols into digital humanities projects writ large, and
introduces participants to two initiatives towards these ends. Although these two initiatives are
designed explicitly for Indigenous communities, the principles that inform them—responsible
approaches to data ethics, collective privacy, data governance, digital infrastructure, and
responsive policy—are relevant to any community-based cultural heritage project. (1) Mukurtu
(https://mukurtu.org) is a free and open-source content management system and digital access
tool for cultural heritage, built for and in ongoing dialogue with Indigenous communities.
Mukurtu allows communities to decide how to share materials in culturally appropriate ways,
and to foreground Indigenous knowledge in the metadata of digitized cultural heritage
materials. A hands-on workshop on Mukurtu will be offered later in the day. (2) Local Contexts
(https://localcontexts.org) was founded in 2010 to support Indigenous communities in the
management of intellectual property and cultural heritage specifically within the digital
environment. The initiative provides legal, extra-legal, and educational strategies—including the
TK (Traditional Knowledge) & BC (Biocultural) Labels and Notices—for navigating copyright law
and creating new options for Indigenous control over vital cultural heritage.
* Focus Question: What are the ethical questions of the public digital archive?
### 10:30-10:45 AM: BREAK
### 10:45AM-12 NOON: Participant Project Sharing
#### Facilitators: Kim Christen, Sylvia Fernández, Dave Tell, Brian Rosenblum
* Participants engage in thoughtful conversations about their projects around the focus questions
for the session.
* Focus Questions: What ethical concerns do you have about your project? How can they be
addressed?
### 12:00-1:30PM: LUNCH
* Catered lunch at the Hall Center. Participants dine in small groups with institute staff and guest
faculty for the day.
### 1:30-2:15PM: Digital Platforms and Web Hosting
### Facilitators: Kaylen Dwyer, Brian Rosenblum
### Specialized skill in web development is no longer necessary for building digital projects. There
are many platforms available to choose from whether you are creating a digital archive, multimedia
exhibit, or a web application. This session will provide an introduction to a range of digital
humanities platforms (including Omeka, Scalar, Jekyll, and Wordpress) and how to evaluate
them, considering functionality, technical skill, support, cost, and sustainability. Learners will
also be introduced to web hosting options and what to look for in a shared hosting provider.

## Day 4: Thursday, June 9th, 2022
### 8:00-8:30AM: Sign-in (Coffee and Light Snacks)
### 8:30-9:30AM: CASE STUDY: Under the Rainbow: Oral Histories of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual,
Transgender, and Queer People in Kansas
#### Facilitator: Tami Albin
* Under the Rainbow seeks to document the life stories and experiences of GLBTQ Kansans. It is
the first online open access oral history collection of GLBTQ Kansans in the US. With video and
transcripts of over 60 interviews conducted since 2008, the project gives voice to the diverse
experiences of this community. The interviews challenge people’s assumptions about GLBTQ life
in Kansas and surfaces common themes, such as coming out or not coming out to family and
friends. These are often very personal and moving narratives, but those interviewed want their
stories to be told and available online in the proper context. Albin will share how she reached
out to people across the state, balancing the need for sensitivity and privacy with the speakers’
desire to have their stories heard.
### 9:30-10:30AM: Oral History 101
#### Facilitator: Tami Albin
* Building on the case study presented in the previous session, this session will provide
participants an overview of the creation and implementation of an oral history project.
Participants will be introduced to the following core components of an oral history project:
understanding oral history, ethical and legal considerations, project planning, technology,
designing questions, consent/release forms, the interview process, transcription, and access to
interviews via a digital platform.
* Focus Questions: What are the basic processes, ethical considerations, and technology needs
for conducing oral history interviews?
* Readings:
### 10:30-10:45AM: BREAK
### 10:45AM-12 NOON: Participant Project Sharing
#### Facilitators: Dave Tell, Sylvia Fernández
* Participants engage in thoughtful conversations about their projects around the focus questions
for the session.
* Focus Questions: Does your project engage stakeholder stories? If so, how?
### 12:00-1:30PM: LUNCH
* Catered lunch at the Hall Center. Participants dine in small groups with institute staff and guest
faculty for the day.
### 1:30-3:00PM: Project Funding
#### Facilitator: Sarah Bishop
* This session will provide an introduction to fundraising for a public digital humanities project.
Bishop will share customizable templates for creating a project case statement, budget,
fundraising plan, and donor/sponsor benefit guide. Through small-group work, participants will
leave the session with a fundraising plan outline as well as a deeper understanding of what their
project costs are and how to go about seeking funding to cover those costs.
* Focus Questions: What are your sources of funding for your project? How will you develop a
funding plan?
### 3:00-3:15PM: BREAK
### 3:15-5:00PM: TECH TRAINING BREAKOUT SESSION
* Participants may choose one of the two following sessions:
* (1) Digital Audio and Video Production for Oral History and Digital Storytelling
o Facilitator: Tami Albin
o The technology needed to record interviews and create post-production content is a rapidly
changing field. The advantage of these changes include portability, lower cost, and usability.
The disadvantage is the same as the advantage. Rapid creation of newer technologies create
challenges and issues regarding accessibility and obsolescence. This lack of longevity can
render equipment and software useless within five to ten years. In this session we will
discuss hardware and software options, budgeting, developing good data management
habits, and issues surrounding archiving and preservation.
* (2) Access, Ownership, and Reuse
o Facilitator: Josh Bolick
o This session will provide a foundational introduction to U.S. copyright law that addresses
both the rights of creators as well as users. The goal is basic copyright literacy that is useful
for all 21st century citizens, both in and out of the academy, to enable collaboration across
stakeholder groups in which all parties share in ownership and awareness of the rights and
opportunities of ownership. This portion of the workshop will be informed by the U.S.
Copyright Office Circular 1: Copyright Basics (https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ01.pdf)
and A Framework for Analyzing Any U.S. Copyright Problem by Smith and Macklin
(http://hdl.handle.net/1808/22723). Building on this foundation, we will explore Creative
Commons licenses as a practical tool enabling a modicum of control with a mind towards
sharing collaborative digital projects. To facilitate this discussion, we will use the Creative
Commons License Chooser tool to apply a license to an object created for the session, such
as the session slides, which will be shared with attendees for future reference.
### 5:00-5:30PM: Daily Feedback and Reflection
#### Facilitators: Brian Rosenblum, Dave Tell
* Participants share their key takeaways from today’s sessions, do a 5-minute free writing
reflection for their own use, and complete a daily feedback slip.
## Day 5: Friday, June 10th, 2022
### 8:00-8:30AM: Sign-in (Coffee and Light Snacks)
### 8:30-9:30AM: CASE STUDY: Ellas Tienen Nombre
#### Facilitator: Ivonne Ramírez
* Ellas Tienen Nombre ("These women have names") is a feminist mapping project that draws
attention to the victims of femicide in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, monitoring and georeferencing
the places where the bodies of murdered girls and women have been found, as well as breaking
down the specificities and data of each of the cases. Recognizing that the visual impact of the
map and photos is different from sharing information through statistics with graphs, the project
tries to communicate the gravity of violence against girls and women, and allows us to explore
how the larger social and political contexts impact the girls and women who live in this
particular geopolitical border region. It was founded by Ivonne Ramírez as an independent
project, undertaken without institutional support, to counter the lack of publicly available and
accessible information on this subject, to document this aspect of the present and historical
memory of the region, and to mobilize voices of protest, justice, and solidarity.
### 9:30-10:30AM: Telling Stories with Community-grounded Cartography and Data
#### Facilitator: Sylvia Fernández
* In this session we will share public and digital humanities projects that have used mapping and
visualization of data as a form to offer collective spaces of imagination, creation of new
knowledge, and models to reach out to multiple communities and do public social justice work.
Participants will work in teams to explore and analyze various projects (Mapa Escritoras
Mexicanas, Torn Apart/Separados, Mapping Modern Jewish Culture, New Roots: Voices from
North Carolina / Nuevas Raíces: Voces de Carolina del Norte, Chicana por mi Raza) to learn the
way they collect and use their data, the platform used and the way these maps and
visualizations are presented to engage with the public. Later in the day participants will have the
opportunity to create their own datasets, maps, and visualizations in a hands-on workshop.
* Focus Question: How can we tell community stories to make impactful social changes utilizing
maps and visualizations?
### 10:30-10:45AM: BREAK
### 10:45AM-12 NOON: Participant Project Sharing
#### Facilitators: Sylvia Fernández, Ivonne Ramírez
* Participants engage in thoughtful conversations about their projects around the focus questions
for the session.
* Focus Questions: What kinds of data does your project use or create? How could you
incorporate data visualization into your project?
### 12:00-1:30PM: LUNCH
* Catered lunch at the Hall Center. Participants dine in small groups with institute staff and guest
faculty for the day.
### 1:30-3:00PM: Project Marketing
#### Facilitator: Sarah Bishop
* This session will provide an overview of how to market a public digital humanities project.
Bishop will share customizable templates for a multi-platform marketing plan as well as a
sample press release that participants can use to brainstorm how to communicate with
partners, stakeholders, and the general public about their project at each step of its evolution.
Bishop will also connect marketing and fundraising, demonstrating the ways in which marketing,
while an additional project cost, is a powerful aspect of the fundraising process itself.
* Focus Question: How will you market your project to ensure it reaches your intended
audiences?
### 3:00-3:15PM: BREAK
### 3:15-5:00PM: TECH TRAINING BREAKOUT SESSION
* Participants may choose one of the two following sessions:
* (1) Metadata and Data Management for Digital Humanities Projects
o Facilitator: Erin Wolfe
o This session will provide an introduction to creating and managing data and metadata for a
variety of DH projects. With an emphasis on practical application, we will cover what
metadata is (and what you need), why it's important, and how to effectively create and
manage metadata from the beginning. We will also look at aspects of data management,
project documentation, preservation, and other topics integral to a successful DH project.
Participants will be provided with readings and resources to make use of after the institute.
* (2) Mapping and Visualizing for the Public
o Facilitator: Sylvia Fernández
o In this hands-on workshop, building on discussions in earlier sessions, participants will
create sample datasets particular to their projects and learn how to incorporate the data file
to a mapping or visualization platform using Carto and RAWGraphs. By the end of the
workshop, participants will have gained some introductory, hands-on experience in the
creation of data for digital mapping and visualizations and discussed ideas about how to
integrate these techniques into their public digital humanities project.
### 5:00-5:30PM: Daily Feedback and Reflection
#### Facilitators: Brian Rosenblum, Dave Tell
* Participants share their key takeaways from today’s sessions, do a 5-minute free writing

### 8:00-8:30AM: Sign-in (Coffee and Light Snacks)
### 8:30-9:30AM: CASE STUDY: The Emmett Till Memory Project
#### Facilitators: Patrick Weems, Dave Tell
* Names a top 5% public humanities project in the country by the National Humanities Alliance, the
Emmett Till Memory Project is a mobile application designed to capture local histories of the
1955 murder of Emmett Till in the Mississippi Delta. It is designed as a public/digital response to
specific conditions of remembrance. After Emmett Till was killed in 1955, forty-nine years and
eleven months passed before the state of Mississippi spent a single dollar on commemoration.
When commemoration did come, it was plagued by vandalism. In collaboration with the Till
family in Chicago, and with a nonprofit in the Mississippi Delta, the Emmett Till Memory Project
provides a free, publicly accessible, vandal proof form of commemoration. It is designed to
capture the complexity of the story by being faithful to the experiences of those who live closest
to the murder.
* 9:30-10:30AM: Accessible and inclusive web design
#### Facilitators: Kaylen Dwyer, Sylvia Fernández, Brian Rosenblum, Dave Tell
* This session considers various aspects of accessible and inclusive web design, including
principles of accessible design, Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, accessibility strategies for
different disability types, and approaches to creating multi-lingual sites. We will also consider
the pros and cons of using smartphone applications for the digital public humanities.
Considerations include the availability and distribution of technological infrastructure (e.g., wifi
in rural communities), the added development costs of making an app versus a responsive
website, and sustainability of the app platform. Participants will be provided with resources to
pursue these topics further.
* Focus Questions: How do you ensure your web-based project is accessible and inclusive?
