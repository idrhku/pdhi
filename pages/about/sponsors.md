The Hall Center for the Humanities

The Hall Center has long been at the leading edge of the public humanities. For the last seven years, the Hall Centerâ€™s Scholars-on-Site program has funded faculty and students working with community partners on matters of common concern. The Hall Center and the IDRH are currently collaborating on Stories For All, an Andrew W. Mellon Foundation-funded initiative that brings together community and University of Kansas partners from over 40 regional projects to address opportunities, challenges, ethics and politics of storytelling in the digital era.
