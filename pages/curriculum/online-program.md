## Workshops
Six 90-minute webinar-style workshops will include technical trainings and discussions that expand  upon the topics covered during the in-person program, or delve into new areas. Specific topics will be determined in collaboration with the participants, based on their needs at the end of the in-person  program. 

## Consultations
Institute staff or faculty will conduct hour-long consultations with each project team, four times during the course of the year. 


## Virtual Symposium
At the end of the year, in June 2023, we will host a virtual symposium featuring final presentations from project teams, reporting on progress made during the year and sharing reflections. The  presentations will be recorded and posted on the institute website for public viewing.
