The program is built around a wide-ranging but complementary mix of topics and includes several broad types of sessions, summarized below.

## Case Studies
Each day of the institute will open with a case study presented by that project’s director. These case studies highlight a range of platforms and modes of digital scholarship (e.g., archiving, mapping, oral  histories, storytelling) and will provide participants with real-world examples to draw from.

## Interactive Learning and Discussion Sessions
Significant time will be devoted to interactive learning and discussion. Led by community partners as well as academics, these sessions will focus on topics such as sustaining digital humanities projects, fundraising and marketing, developing strong community parterships, and principles of public humanities.

## Technical Training
These introductory sessions on platforms, tools, content production, and rights & ownership will help participants better understand the options available to them and resources available to pursue these topics further. Some sessions will be offered concurrently, with participants able to choose one of two sessions. This allows for smaller, more-effective hands-on sessions, while still allowing team members to split up and attend all workshops offered.

## Online Program
After the completion of the in-person program, the institute will continue virtually for one year. This is the time for the participants to return home and put the lessons learned during the in-person week into practice to advance their projects. Institute staff will provide structure and content in the form of workshops, consultations, and email discussions.
