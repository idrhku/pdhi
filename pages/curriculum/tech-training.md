The emphasis of the technical track is on developing an awareness and understanding of foundational concepts and common tools and methods, rather than proficiency in a specific tool or method. These introductory sessions on platforms, tools, content production, and rights & ownership will help participants better understand the options available to them and resources available to pursue these topics further. 

Some sessions will be offered concurrently, with  participants able to choose one of two sessions. This allows for smaller, more-effective hands-on sessions, while still allowing team members to split up and attend all workshops offered.
