- Six 90-minute **webinar-style workshops** will include technical trainings and discussions that expand  upon the topics covered during the in-person program, or delve into new areas. Specific topics will be determined in collaboration with the participants, based on their needs at the end of the in-person  program. These workshops will be led by institute staff or faculty who have agreed to participate in the year-long program. 
- Institute staff or faculty will conduct hour-long **consultations** with each project team, four times during the course of the year. 
- Institute staff will maintain an **email discussion list** where participants can ask questions, share developments, and alert each other to external opportunities. Institute staff will take an active role in  seeding the listserv with discussion topics and announcements to maintain an active community. 
- At the end of the year, in June 2023, we will host a **virtual symposium** featuring final presentations from project teams, reporting on progress made during the year and sharing reflections. The  presentations will be recorded and posted on the institute website for public viewing.
