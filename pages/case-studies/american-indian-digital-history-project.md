The American Indian Digital History Project, a cooperative founded to recover and preserve rare Indigenous newspapers, photographs, and archival materials from across Native North America. The project seeks to increase access to historical Tribal documents in order to encourage accurate and responsible American Indian research. Furthermore, the project will be seeking partnerships with Tribal governments and archives to create a digital repository for local Tribes. 

This innovative digital project is a cooperative partnership between the University of Kansas, the University of Nebraska at Omaha (UNO), Tribal communities, Tribal Colleges, Native organizations, Libraries, Universities/Colleges, and the larger public. 

The American Indian Digital History Project (AIDHP) was founded to forge digital partnerships with Native Nations and Indigenous communities located throughout the surrounding region of Nebraska with the intent of expanding the project nationally. This digital cooperative will start with digitizing key primary source documents like Akwesasne Notes and will make these sources free, searchable, and accessible to the greater public.

AIDHP works partnership with Native peoples and communities to promote the recovery, sharing, preservation, and protection of rare Tribal archival and primary source materials. AIDHP and a host of public and private institutions will greatly benefit from this expanding partnership of shared archival sources that can better inform scholarship and research about Indigenous peoples.
