The institute program is built around a wide-ranging but complementary mix of topics and includes 3 broad types of sessions—(a) interactive learning and discussion; (b) case studies;  and (c) technical training—summarized below. 

## Interactive Learning and Discussion Sessions

Some stuff about the discussion series.

## Case Studies
Both the digital humanities and the public humanities make extensive use of case  studies to share knowledge and provide models for work, and the institute will embrace this approach. 

Each day of the institute will open with a case study presented by that project’s director. These case  studies highlight a range of platforms and modes of digital scholarship (e.g., archiving, mapping, oral  histories, storytelling) and will provide participants with real-world examples to draw from.

## Technical Training
The emphasis of the technical track is on developing an awareness and understanding of foundational concepts and common tools and methods, rather than proficiency in a specific tool or method. These introductory sessions will give participants knowledge of the options available to them and resources available to pursue these topics further. Some sessions will be offered concurrently, with  participants able to choose one of two sessions. This allows for smaller, more-effective hands-on sessions, while still allowing team members to split up and attend all workshops offered. 


In addition to these sessions, we have also incorporated time each day for participants to network, explore and share with each other. We believe this will be one of the most valuable aspects of the  institute. _Participant Project Sharing_ sessions will let participants engage in conversation about their  projects around a specific focus question for each session. 90-minute catered lunch periods will offer a  chance for participants to dine in small groups with each other and with the institute faculty present that  day (and an opportunity to take a break and explore the beautiful KU campus). Each day will conclude with a _feedback and reflection period_, where participants will share key takeaways from the day, do  several minutes of silent writing for their own use to help them capture and synthesize ideas before the  day ends, and submit a short, anonymous feedback slip about the day’s sessions. The afternoon of the  final day will feature teams presenting _lightning talks_ about their key takeaways from the institute and  next steps.

## Online Program
After the completion of the in-person program, the institute will continue virtually  for one year. This is the time for the participants to return home and put the lessons learned during the in person week into practice to advance their projects. Institute staff will provide structure and content in the  form of workshops, consultations, and email discussions.
